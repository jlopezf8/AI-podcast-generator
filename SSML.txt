    So, have you heard about the new exhibit at Naturalis in Leiden? They're showcasing a herd of Triceratops skeletons, and I'm super stoked about it.

<voice name="Andrew">
    Yeah, I've heard about it. It's a big deal, right? I mean, Triceratops are already an iconic dinosaur, and now we get to see a whole herd of them together.

<voice name="Ava">
    Exactly! And what's even more amazing is that these skeletons were found in Wyoming back in 2013. Can you believe it? Five individuals, all from the same site.

<voice name="Andrew">
    That's incredible. I've always been fascinated by the idea of finding a dinosaur fossil, let alone a whole herd of them. The team at Naturalis must have been thrilled.

<voice name="Ava">
    I know, right? It's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. And now, we get to experience it for ourselves. I've heard the exhibit is going to be interactive, with games and stuff. Have you heard anything about that?
    <break time="0.5s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Andrew">
    Yeah, I've heard it's going to be really hands-on. You'll be able to collect food like a Triceratops, learn about their digestive system, and even hear what their, ahem, "unique" flatulence sounded like.

<voice name="Ava">
    That sounds hilarious. And I've also heard you can crawl inside a Triceratops egg and see how the babies grew. That's just mind-blowing.
    <break time="0.5s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Andrew">
    Totally. It's amazing to think about these creatures roaming the earth millions of years ago. And now, we get to see them up close and personal.
    <break time="0.3s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Ava">
    Exactly. And I love that Naturalis is making it accessible to everyone. It's not just about the science; it's about sharing the wonder and excitement of discovery.
    <break time="0.5s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Andrew">
    Absolutely. I think that's what I love most about this exhibit. It's not just for dinosaur enthusiasts; it's for anyone who's ever been curious about the natural world.
    <break time="0.3s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Ava">
    Well, I'm definitely curious. I'm planning on checking it out as soon as it opens. How about you?
    <break time="0.5s"/>
</voice>
<voice name="Andrew">
    Same here. I'll be there with my kids, who are already super excited about it. It's going to be a fun day out for all of us.
    <break time="0.3s"/>

<voice name="Ava">
    That sounds great. I'm sure they'll love it. And who knows, maybe it'll inspire the next generation of paleontologists.

    You never know. Stranger things have happened.
